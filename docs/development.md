## First-time setup

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (at least the latest LTS)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (at least 1.0)

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies from package.json
yarn install
```

> Note: don't delete yarn.lock before installation

### Database

> Note: Awesome nest boilerplate uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) with Data Mapper pattern.

### Configuration

Before start install PostgreSQL and fill correct configurations in `.development.env` file

```env
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DATABASE=nest_boilerplate
```

Some helper script to work with database

```bash
# To create new migration file
yarn typeorm:migration:create migration_name

# Truncate full database (note: it isn't deleting the database)
yarn typeorm:schema:drop

# Generate migration from update of entities
yarn migration:generate migration_name
```

### Dev server

> Note: If you're on Linux and see an `ENOSPC` error when running the commands below, you must [increase the number of available file watchers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22475849/node-js-error-enospc#answer-32600959).

```bash
# Launch the dev server
yarn start:dev

# Launch the dev server with file watcher
yarn watch:dev

# Launch the dev server and enable remote debugger with file watcher
yarn debug:dev
```

## Generators

This project includes generators to speed up common development tasks. Commands include:

> Note: Make sure you already have the nest-cli globally installed

```bash
# Install nest-cli globally
yarn global add @nestjs/cli

# Generate a new service
nest generate service users

# Generate a new class
nest g class users

```
> Note: if you love generators then you can find full list of command in official [Nest-cli Docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages#generate-alias-g).

## Docker

if you are familiar with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) then you can run built in docker-compose file, which will install and configure application and database for you.

### Docker installation

Download docker from Official website

- Mac <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/>
- Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>
- Ubuntu <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>

### Docker-compose installation

Download docker from [Official website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

### Run

Open terminal and navigate to project directory and run the following command.

```bash
PORT=3000 docker-compose up
```

> Note: application will run on port 3000 (<http://localhost:3000>)

Navigate to <http://localhost:8080> and connect to you database with the following configurations

```text
host: postgres
user: postgres
pass: postgres
```

create database `nest_boilerplate` and your application fully is ready to use.
